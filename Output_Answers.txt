Question 1
s1 : 51.2 | s2 : 64 | s3 : 0 | 
s4 : 64 | s5 : 80 | s6 : 100 | 
Iterations : 5

Question 2
s1->s2->s5->s6->s3
or
s1->s4->s5->s6->s3

Question 3
Yes, If we change the immediate reward by multiplying it with a constant factor for example doubling each reward, the V* is also doubled, but Ï€* remains unchanged.
The optimal policy is calculated by the sequence of states with the highest utility.
As long as the changes to the rewards are minor such that the state utility changes but the optimal sequence of states does not change the optimal policy will not change.
